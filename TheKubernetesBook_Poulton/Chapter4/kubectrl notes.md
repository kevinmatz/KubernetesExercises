# Notes on kubectl command

- See pod manifest file: pod.yml
  - Defines a pod named `hello-pod` with one container, `hello-ctr`
- `kubectl apply -f pod.yml`
  - Applies the specification "directly", i.e., takes actions to move from the "observed state" to the "desired state" (so it creates/instantiates/runs a pod as per the pod manifest file, without using a controller)
- `kubectl get pods`
  - Shows status
- `kubectl get pods --watch -o wide`
- `kubectl get pods hello-pod -o yaml`
  - Shows full YAML description of pod
- `kubectl describe pods hello-pod`
  - Gives details including the ordering of containers in the pod (which one is considered the "first", etc.)
- `kubectl logs hello-pod`
  - Shows logs from `hello-pod` pod
- `kubectl logs hello-pod --container syncer`
  - Shows logs from the `syncer` container within the `hello-pod` pod
- `kubectl exec <pod-name> -- <command>`
  - Runs a command in a pod
    - Example: `kubectl exec hello-pod -- ps`
- `kubectl exec -it hello-pod -- sh`
  - Logs in to the first container in a pod and runs a shell (if there are multiple containers in the pod, you need to use `--container <container-name>`)
    - `-it` flags make the session interactive and connect STDIN and STDOUT in your terminal to STDIN and STDOUT in the container
- `kubectl edit pod hello-pod`
  - Lets you edit some attributes, though because pods are designed to be immutable, you cannot change most things (such as pod name, container name, container port, etc.)
- `kubectl delete pod <pod-name>` (or `delete pods`)
  - Deletes (stops and removes) a running pod
- `kubectl get services`
  - Shows all running services
- `kubectl delete service <service-name>`
  - Deletes (stops and removes) a running service
