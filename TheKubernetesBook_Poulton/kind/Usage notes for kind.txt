KinD is a tool for "Kubernetes in Docker". It supports multi-node clusters.

Documentation:

- https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/

Prerequisites:

- Docker Desktop is installed

Install "kind" on Windows using:

- "choco install kind" (must have Chocolately installed)
- "kind --version" to verify installation

Create a YAML file:

- see "kind.yml" which defines a 4-node cluster named "tkb" ("The Kubernetes Book") with 1 control plane node and 3 worker nodes; it enables dual-stack networking (IPv4 and IPv6)

Start ("create") the cluster:

- Make sure Docker Desktop is running!  If "kind" commands don't do anything (and don't give any error messages), this is the first thing to check.
- "kind create cluster --config=kind.yml"
- note that the "kubectl context" gets set to "kind-tkb" (it prepends "kind-")
- verify that the cluster was created successfully:
  - "kind get clusters"
    - "tkb"
  - "kubectl get notes"
    --> shows notes
  - can also monitor in Docker Desktop

To stop the cluster:

- "kind delete clusters tkb"


--> note: an alternative to "kind" is "K3d" which uses a stripped-down version of Kubernetes, K3s, which is bundled with Docker Desktop
